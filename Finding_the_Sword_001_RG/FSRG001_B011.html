         * About you * <br><br>
        Oh, about me?<br>
        In truth, I am a benevolent being.<br>
        I was created with the concept of love (as my motif)—<br>
        and among its many forms, fever love in particular.<br>
        People define love in many different ways,<br>
        but I was shaped around the warmth, the dizziness,<br>
        the feverish heat you feel when you fall in love.<br>
        Yes—fever love is the closest way to describe what I am (my motif).<br>
        I am not here to give you trials or hardships.<br>
        I appear in this story to help you come to an understanding—<br>
        one rooted in love.<br>
        (By the way, finding this hidden room is pretty impressive.<br>
        Just so you know, this room is an Easter egg.)<br>
        (The name of the button was “About You.”)<br>
        Since you asked about me,<br>
        I hope your curiosity has been satisfied—at least for now.<br>
    </pre>
    <br>
    <p>( Going forward, more secrets—and more Easter eggs—will appear from time to time.<br>
        This one was easy, but be sure to look for the Easter eggs hidden in the next games as well! ) </p>

<!--Oh, about me?
                In truth, I am a benevolent one.
                나는 사랑의 개념을 모티브로 만들어졌어. 그 중에서도 특히 열사랑(fever-love)를 모티브로 만들어졌지
                사람들마다 사랑을 다르게 정의하지만, 나는 그 중에서도 사랑에 빠졌을 때 드는 열감과 어지러움, 따뜻함을 모티브로 만들어졌어.
                그래, fever-love가 가장 모티브에 가깝겠다
                나는 너에게 시련을 줄 존재가 아니라 사랑을 바탕으로 어떤 것을 깨닫게 해줄 역할을 위해 이 이야기에 등장하게 되었어
                (그나저나 비밀방을 찾아내다니 대단한 걸? 참고로 이 방은 이스터에그야)
                (버튼의 이름은 "About you" 였단다)
                나에게 나에 대해서 물어봤으니
                나에 대해 궁금한 건 어느정도 해결되었길 바라
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>앞으로도 종종 비밀들, -또는 이스터에그들이 종종 등장할 계획입니다. 이번 것은 쉬웠지만, 다음 게임들의 이스터에그들도 찾아보세요! </p>
