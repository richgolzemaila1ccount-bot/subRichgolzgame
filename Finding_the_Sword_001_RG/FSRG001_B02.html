       The stone you carry is, in truth, the legendary core.
This stone is given only to the one who truly deserves it.

That core is the sword itself.
In other words, you had already obtained the sword from the very beginning.

Yet the reason this journey is called an adventure
is that the one who receives the stone must pass through three trials alongside it
in order to truly obtain the legendary sword—
a sword no one else can ever claim.

The first and most important condition to obtain the legendary sword
is to desire it by your own will.

Because you chose to pray of your own free will,
you were chosen at that moment,
and the stone was placed in your hands.

(You feel a deep sense of fulfillment.
You realize you had it from the very beginning.)
(Your prayer had already been answered.)

The second trial is love.

If, in your life, you have ever loved another person,
then I will be shown to me.

Love is beautiful in and of itself.

(You feel a deep sense of fulfillment.)
(As great as the love that person gave you,
so too is the depth of the fulfillment you now feel.)

The third trial is wisdom.

Near this place lies a river—
the closest, the deepest, and the most magnificent of all.
It is both a river and a sea.

Its depths are immense.
Perhaps so deep that simply looking into it feels frightening.

Wash the sword within that river.

(You feel a deep sense of fulfillment.
A vast sea.
A profound river.)

Now, do you understand?

<!--사실 네가 가지고 있는 돌은 전설의 원석이야. 이 돌은 반드시 가장 deserve한 사람에게만 쥐어져.
    
    그 원석은 검 그 자체로, 너는 이미 처음부터 검을 얻은 것과 같았던 거야.
    하지만 이 검을 얻는 과정이 모험이라고 불리는 이유는
    그 돌을 얻은 사람이 그 돌과 함께 세 가지 과정을 거쳐야
    다른 사람은 얻을 수 없는
    전설 속의 검을 진정으로 얻을 수 있게 돼.
    
    전설의 검을 얻기 위한 가장 첫번째이자 중요한 조건은
    자신의 "의지"로 바라는 것이야.
    자신의 의지로 기도하기로 선택했기 때문에, 너는 그 때 선택받고 돌을 받았어.

    (당신은 깊은 만족감을 느낀다. 나는 처음부터 이미 가지고 있었던 것이었다.)
    (기도는 응답되었던 것이었다.)


    두 번째 과정은 사랑이야.
    네가 살면서 타인을 사랑해본 적이 있다면,
    거울에 비치듯이, 네가 사랑했던 그 사람이 나에게 보여질 거야.(will be reflected)
    사랑은 그 자체로 아름다워.

    (당신은 깊은 만족감을 느낀다. 
    (그 사람이 나에게 주었던 사랑의 크기 만큼,
    당신은 깊은 만족감을 느꼈다.)

    세 번째 과정은 지혜야.
    이곳에서 가장 가까운 곳에, 가장 깊고 가장 웅장한 강이 하나 있어. 그 강은 강이기도 또한 바다이기도 해.
    그 강은 정말 깊어. 어쩌면 너무 깊어서 쳐다보기조차 무서울지도 몰라.
    그 강에서 그 검을 씻어.

    
    (당신은 깊은 만족감을 느낀다. 아주 깊은 바다. 아주 깊은 강.)

    이제, 알게 되었니?

<!--In truth, the stone you carry is the legendary core.

This stone is given only to those who truly deserve it.

The sword of legend cannot be obtained by just anyone.
Only those who are worthy may wield it.

And for that very reason, this stone, too, is placed only in the hands of the chosen.

That core is the sword itself.
From the very beginning, it was as if you had already obtained the blade.

Yet the reason this process is called an adventure
is that the one who receives the stone must pass through three trials with it
before they can truly claim the legendary sword—
a sword no one else can obtain.

The First Trial: Will

The very first—and most important—condition
is to desire it by your own will.

If you can truly wish for something, you can have it.

But most people do not wish.
They do not desire.
They do not allow hope to take root in their hearts.

Most simply accept things as they are,
grow numb,
and fall silent.

They do not even choose to wish.

That is why you were chosen.

You chose to desire—
by your own will.

There is no one more deserving of this sword than you.

You already possess it.

You feel a deep sense of fulfillment.
You realize that you had it from the very beginning.
Your prayer had already been answered.

The Second Trial: Love

The second trial is love.

At some point in your life, you have loved another.
Whether that person was family,
a friend,
or a lover.

If you have ever loved another,
then—like a reflection in a mirror—
the one you loved will be shown to me.

Love is essential.
It is the most beautiful value in this world,
and it will allow you to shine even more brightly.

Just as this sword takes form from its core,
love, too, allows the most beautiful values
to exist more fully as themselves.

Love is beautiful in and of itself.
And love has the power
to make what is already beautiful
even more so.

That is what love is.

You feel a deep sense of fulfillment.
“That person” was with you from the very beginning.
They will remain with you, forever, within your heart.

Whether through the love you received,
or through the love you gave—even if it was never returned—
that person will remain with you forever, as the experience of having loved.

You feel a deep sense of fulfillment.

The Third Trial: Wisdom

The third trial is wisdom.

Not far from here lies a river—
the deepest and most magnificent of all.

It is both a river and a sea.

In that vast and profound body of water,
you must wash the sword.

But the river is so deep
that it may reflect many sides of you.

As you gaze into it,
you may be forced to confront every aspect of yourself
mirrored on its surface.

That process will give you depth.

Yet because you must look into such an unfathomable abyss,
its depth may feel terrifying.

Still, at the very bottom—
so deep it is almost unbearable to face—
you may come to see
the parts of yourself you feared most,
the parts you never wished to confront.

You feel a deep sense of fulfillment.
A vast sea. A profound river.
A river that becomes both your mirror and your depth.

Its depth is frightening, yet it is the mirror that allows you to face your deepest fears.
You feel a deep sense of fulfillment.

Now—

Do you understand?
