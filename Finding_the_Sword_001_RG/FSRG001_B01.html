        As you walk down the road, you suddenly notice the sky growing brighter.
Without thinking, you lift your head to see where the light is coming from.

The sky is indeed brighter than on a clear day.
The sun is descending from the heavens—toward you.

You realize that it is the sun.
Yet somehow, it has the shape of a person.

The sun appears wearing a crimson chiton, the kind of garment an ancient Greek god might wear.
As it descends from the sky, the edges of its robe flutter gently in the air.

You feel a gentle warmth.
It feels as though the cold in your heart is being driven away.
The sun gazes at you kindly.

“My Dear,”
the sun says, looking at you with tender eyes.
“If the outcome isn’t what you hoped for,”
“don’t hate it too much—choose love instead.”

(The warmth grows stronger.)

“Everything is already beautiful, just as it is.”

“And the most precious things,”
“often come from love.”
The sun continues to look at you with affection.

“Perhaps love is what creates the most beautiful things of all.”

The sun looks down at you.

As you feel the warmth in the gentle expression and voice of the being before you,
you begin to think that this warmth might be the key—
perhaps even the answer—you have been searching for.

As you continue to feel the presence’s warmth, a realization slowly dawns on you.
You understand that the being before you is not the sun.

It is something else.
Something warm—perhaps, in some ways, even warmer than the sun itself.
And perhaps this being knows the answer.

“I’ll tell you more about the legendary sword.”

The sun smiles softly as it looks down at you.
The edges of its robe still flutter in the air.

<!--당신은 길을 걷던 도중, 갑자기 하늘이 밝아지는 것을 느낍니다.
    당신은 자연스럽게 고개를 들어 그 밝은 빛을 확인하려고 합니다.

    하늘이 맑은 날보다 약간 더 밝아진 것이 맞았습니다.
    태양이 하늘에서 당신 쪽으로 내려왔습니다.

    당신은 그것이 태양이라는 것을 알았습니다.
    하지만 마치 사람의 형상이었습니다.

    태양이 다홍빛 chiton-tic(고대 그리스 신이 입을법한) 옷을 입고(걸치고) 나타났습니다.
    고대 그리스 신이 입을법한 옷을 입고 하늘에서 내려오는 태양의 옷깃이 하늘거립니다.

    태양이 묻습니다.
    "너는 사랑에 대해서 알고 있니?" (네)
/

    당신은 따뜻한 온기를 느낍니다.
    마음의 추위를 몰아내는 것 같습니다.
    태양이 당신을 다정하게 바라봅니다.
    "얘야,"
    태양이 당신을 다정한 눈빛으로 바라봅니다.
    "만약에, 결과가 마음에 들지 않는다면,"
    "너무 미워하지 말고 사랑을 하렴."
       (따뜻한 온기가 느껴집니다.)
    "모든 것은 있는 그대로 이미 아름다워."
    
    /

    "그리고 가장 값진 것은"
    "사랑에서부터 오기도 해."
    태양은 당신을 다정하게 바라봅니다.
    "어쩌면 가장 아름다운 것을 만드는 것은 사랑이야."
    태양이 당신을 내려다봅니다.

    당신은 당신을 바라보는 눈 앞의 존재의 상냥하고 따뜻한 표정과 말투에서 온기를 느끼며,
    지금 느끼는 이 온기가 어쩌면 당신이 찾는 것으로 다가가는 열쇠이자 해답일지도 모른다고 생각했습니다.

    당신은 당신 눈 앞의 존재의 따스함을 느끼다가, 이윽고 깨닫습니다.
    당신은 당신의 눈 앞의 그 존재가 태양이 아님을 알아챘습니다.
    그 존재는 태양이 아닌 다른 어떤, 따뜻한 것입니다. 어쩌면 어떤 의미에서는 태양보다도 더 따뜻한 어떤 것.
    어쩌면 눈 앞의 저 존재가 해답을 알고 있는 걸지도 모르겠습니다.
    
    "내가 전설의 검에 대해서 좀 더 알려줄게."
    태양은 다정하게 웃으며 당신을 내려다봅니다.
    여전히 옷깃이 나풀거립니다. -->








<!--As you walk along the road, you suddenly sense the sky growing brighter.
The weather was already clear and pleasant as you walked,
yet now the sunlight feels warmer—
just a little brighter, as if something gentler and kinder is pouring down from above.
Without thinking, you lift your head to look toward the light.
The sky truly is brighter than on an ordinary clear day.
The sun is descending toward you.
More precisely—
it takes the form of the person you loved most in your life,
the one who taught you what it means to love another.
The warmest, kindest presence you have ever known.
You instinctively understand that this is the sun, appearing before you by mimicking the form of the person you loved most.
Because you loved that person more deeply than anyone else in the world,
you sense—just as instinctively—that although the appearance is exactly the same,
this being is not truly them.
The sun, taking the shape of “that person,” appears clad in a deep rose-colored, chiton-inspired garment,
the kind an ancient Greek god might wear.
As the sun descends from the sky, the edges of its flowing robes flutter gently in the air.
“That person” was the one who taught you what it means to love another—
more precisely, what that feeling is like,
how beautiful it can be.
And so the sun appears in their likeness.
With rose-colored hems swaying softly, the sun slows and comes to a gentle stop in the air,
hovering just above you, looking down.
Why does the sun have to be so cruel as to wear that face?
The face you might never see again.
The face you might see if you were to return.
The face you might long for forever.
The sun gazes at you softly, wearing that face.
As you look up at the sun bearing “that person’s” face,
you feel a quiet resentment toward it.
Why did you come back only now? Or— Thank you.
You swallow once more all the words you were never able to say to “that person,”
and slowly lift your gaze toward the sun.
At last, the sun—
wearing the face of the person you loved most,
the one who taught you what it feels like to love another—
opens its mouth to speak.
“Do you understand love now?”
Yes
Love.
It truly is a beautiful word.
You wonder why the sun feels so warm,
whether getting close to it was not supposed to burn you.
A few meters away—
or perhaps only a few running steps—
the sun gazes at you from a distance that feels almost within reach.
You feel its warmth.
It seems to drive away the cold within your heart.
You feel that gentle warmth again.
The sun looks at you kindly.
“My child,”
The sun gazes at you with tender eyes.
“If the outcome is not what you hoped for,”
(you feel a warm presence)
“do not hate it too much—choose love instead.”
“Everything is already beautiful, just as it is.”
“And the most precious things,”
“sometimes come from love.”
The sun looks at you gently, wearing the face of “that person” you once loved.
“Perhaps love is what creates the most beautiful things of all.”
The sun looks down at you.
From the sun’s gentle expression and warm voice as it looks at you,
you feel a quiet warmth spreading through your heart.
As you sense the warmth of the being before you,
you begin to think that this warmth—
what you are feeling right now—
might be the key, the answer, drawing you closer to what you have been searching for.
In that moment, you realize that you have been wandering for a long time.
As you continue to feel the warmth of the presence before you,
you finally come to understand—
You realize that the being before your eyes is not the sun.
It is something just a little warmer than the sun,
something closer to heat and warmth itself.
It is something warm that is not the sun—
perhaps, in some sense, something even warmer than the sun.
Perhaps the being before you knows the answer.
“I’ll tell you a little more about the legendary sword.”
The sun looks down at you, smiling gently.
The hems of its robes still flutter softly in the air.
