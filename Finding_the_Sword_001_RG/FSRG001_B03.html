        You realize that the being before you is Heat.

        Heat is the sun—
        and yet, at the same time, only a part of it.

        In this world, the sun chose to send down a fragment of itself—
        something closer to a shadow than a true reflection—
        to aid you on your journey.

        Perhaps many of the chosen ones before you,
        and those who will come after,
        also forged their swords with Heat’s guidance.

        Or perhaps you alone are the true hero—
        and what we call legend was nothing more than
        a carefully crafted, meaningful guidebook,
        created to lead you to this very place.

        You instinctively sense that farewell is approaching.

        The being who wore the face of the one you loved most,
        who granted you understanding,
        and who guided your journey—

        Heat prepares to fulfill its final task.

        Before long, Heat returns to its original form:
        a small, crimson sphere, round and no larger than your fist.

        It drifts down near your hands.

        And then—

        Resonating with your core,
        Heat masterfully forges it into a sword.

        Congratulations.
        You have obtained the sword.

        Now, you head to the river
        to cleanse the blade.

<!-- 당신은 그 존재가가 열이라는 것을 눈치챘습니다.
     열은 태양이기도 하나 동시에 태양의 일부입니다.
     이 세계의 태양은 자신의 일부-분신보다 그림자에 가까운-를 내려보내
     당신의 여정을 돕기로 결정했던 것입니다.
     아마 자신의 이전 혹은 이후의 많은 선택받은 자들도,
     열의 도움을 받아 검을 만들었던 걸까요.
     아니면 오로지 자신만이 존재하는 용사이고,
     어쩌면 '전설'이란 자신을 이자리에 이끌기 위해
     누군가가 만들어둔 의미깊은 가이드북이었던 걸까요.
     
     당신은 작별이 다가오고 있음을 직감적으로 느낍니다.
     
     당신이 가장 사랑했던 이의 얼굴을 한,
     그리고 동시에 당신에게 깨달음을 주었고
     자신의 여정을 도와준 존재.
     
     '열'은 자신의 임무를 다하려고 합니다.
     
     이윽고 '열'은 '본래 모습'인 둥그런 주먹만한 붉은 구체가 되어
     당신의 손 근처로 내려옵니다.
     그리고.... 당신의 원석과 반응하여 훌륭하게 당신의 원석을 검으로 제련해냈습니다.
     
     축하합니다.
     당신은 검을 얻었군요.

     당신은 이제 검을 씻으러 강으로 갑니다.
     
     강으로 가기 / 안녕, 친구.
     -->
