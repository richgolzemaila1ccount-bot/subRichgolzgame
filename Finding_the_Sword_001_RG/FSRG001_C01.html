        You arrive at the riverbank.

        Holding the newly forged sword, you stand before the river.
        With a heart that feels both nervous and excited,
        you begin to lower the blade toward the surface of the water.

        The river is unimaginably deep.
        And impossibly wide.
        It is so vast that it could almost be called a sea.

        Is there anyone who could cross to the other side?
        You wonder as you gaze toward the distant, barely visible opposite shore.

        As you continue to wash the sword,
        you absentmindedly glance downward.

        The river is unfathomably deep.

        It feels as though you are staring into a profound abyss.

<!-- 당신은 강가에 도착했습니다.
     당신은 제련된 검을 들고 강의 앞에 섰습니다.
     조금 긴장되지만 설레는 마음으로, 당신은 검을 강물의 표면에 담그기 시작합니다.
     
     강은 무지 깊습니다. 그리고 아주 넓습니다. 이 강은 거의 바다라고 불러도 될 정도입니다.
     어쩌면 이 강의 건너편까지 건널 수 있는 사람이 있을까요?
     당신은 까마득하게 멀리에 희미하게 보이는 강의 건너편을 보며 생각합니다.
     
     당신은 검을 씻다가 ㅁ생각없이 아래를 봅니다.
     강은 아주 무지 깊습니다.
     마치 아주 깊은 심연을 보는 것 같습니다.
     
     /계속해서 검을 씻습니다/-->
